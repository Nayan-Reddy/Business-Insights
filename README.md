## üéØ Project Context & Business Problem

**AtliQ Hardware**, a rapidly growing computer hardware company, has historically relied on intuition and basic Excel analysis for its decision-making. After a significant financial loss from a new store opening in America and facing intense competition from data-savvy rivals, the management team recognized the urgent need to adopt a data-driven culture.

The "Business Insights 360" dashboard was commissioned as the company's first major data analytics initiative. Its primary goal is to provide a single, reliable source of truth that empowers stakeholders across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain** to make strategic decisions backed by data, not intuition.

---

## üìä Dashboard Pages

Here is an overview of the five dedicated pages within the "Business Insights 360" report.

### 1. Finance View
*A dynamic Profit & Loss statement allowing for deep dives into financial performance against targets and previous years.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a business intelligence solution, from raw data to actionable insights.

### 1. ETL & Data Modeling
* **Data Integration:** The project began by integrating data from a hybrid environment, combining transactional records from a **SQL database** with supplementary data from multiple **CSV files**.
* **ETL with Power Query:** A rigorous cleaning and transformation process was performed in Power Query. This included handling null values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and creating a custom Date table using M language to support time intelligence.
* **Advanced Data Model:** A **Galaxy Schema** was implemented to manage the complex relationships between different business processes. This model features multiple fact tables (e.g., `fact_actuals_estimates`, `fact_forecast_monthly`, `marketshare`) and shared, conformed dimension tables (`dim_date`, `dim_product`, `dim_customer`). This design is scalable and optimized for performance. The model includes:
    - `dim_customer`: **75** distinct customers across **27** markets.
    - `dim_product`: **14** product categories across **3** main divisions.
    - `dim_market`: **27** markets across **4** major regions (APAC, EU, etc.).

</p>

### 2. DAX for Advanced Analytics
The analytical power of this dashboard comes from a library of over 30 DAX measures. These measures don't just calculate numbers; they translate data into business insights.

* **Finance View - Dynamic P&L Statements:**
    * A fully interactive Profit & Loss statement was created using a combination of `SWITCH(TRUE())` and `HASONEVALUE`.
    * Implemented a **switchable benchmark** feature, allowing users to compare performance against `Last Year` or `Target` values dynamically.

* **Sales & Marketing - Flexible Performance Analysis:**
    * Used **Field Parameters** to allow users to dynamically switch the dimensions of the analysis (e.g., view sales by `Product` vs. `Customer`, or profitability by `Category` vs. `Segment`).

* **Supply Chain - Actionable Risk Classification:**
    * Calculated key forecasting metrics like `Forecast Accuracy %` and `Net Error %`.
    * Wrote a measure that translates raw error data into actionable business risk categories: **"EI" (Excess Inventory)** or **"OOS" (Out of Stock)**.
    * Used **Time Intelligence** functions like `CALCULATE` to perform Year-over-Year comparisons of forecast accuracy.

* **Executive View - Strategic & Competitive Analysis:**
    * Developed a `Revenue Contribution %` measure using `CALCULATE` and `ALL()` to show how any slice of the business contributes to the grand total.
    * Calculated **Market Share %** and filtered it to show the company's competitive standing (`AtliQ MS %`), moving beyond internal metrics to provide strategic market insights.

* **Dynamic Visuals:** Used **Field Parameters** across multiple pages to allow users to dynamically switch the dimensions of the analysis (e.g., view sales by `Product` vs. `Customer`).
